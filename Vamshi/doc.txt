The dependences need to installed
 1) npm init -y
 2) npm i express ejs socket.io
 3) npm i uuid (To create different id and room for the calls)
 4) npm i --save-dev nodemon (To refresh the server everytime we change)

 
we have to install peers.js for creating ids for webrts which will mange lot of tasks itself
-> npm i -g peers
->To start the peers server ------> peerjs --port 5051

-> to connect with the peer => const mypeer = new Peer(undefined, {
                                    host : "/",
                                    port : '5051'
                                })
